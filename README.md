# Obsidian Universal Publish Plugin

The function of this plugin is simply to package the content of the Obsidian Vault (which can include the Obsidian configuration folder if you need) into a zip file, and then send it to a supported server, and the server will generate website for public access.

This plugin requires a supported server, you can use this project [obsidian-universal-publish-server](https://github.com/shincurry/obsidian-universal-publish-server) directly, or refer to implement your own server.
